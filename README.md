Predicting taxi ride durations in New York City.  

The data from Kaggle including the training and test sets used can be found at

An added note: a feature I would like to include would be to break New York down into x number of neighborhoods.  That way, based on the
pickup and dropoff longitudes and latitudes, we could feed the model the feature of "from where to where" in terms of neighborhoods.  
I reasonably suspect that some spots like lower Manhattan take longer to get around than certain areas in New Jersey or Queens.
